    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pancakes are a classic breakfast and brunch food enjoyed by people of all ages. These fluffy, golden discs are made from a simple batter of flour, eggs, milk, sugar, and baking powder, then cooked on a griddle or frying pan until lightly browned.</p>
    <p>Pancakes are incredibly versatile and can be customized to suit any taste. While they are often served with traditional toppings like maple syrup and butter, you can also get creative with fresh fruits, whipped cream, chocolate chips, or a sprinkle of powdered sugar.</p>
    <p>Whether you prefer them thin and delicate or thick and fluffy, pancakes are a delicious and comforting treat that are easy to make and perfect for any occasion.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>Optional: 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate, medium-sized bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and melted butter. If you are using vanilla extract, add it to this bowl as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine everything:</strong> Pour the wet ingredient mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir just until the ingredients are combined. It's important not to overmix the batter; a few lumps are fine and will help ensure your pancakes are light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the pan:</strong> Heat a lightly oiled griddle or non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the pancakes:</strong> Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using about 1/4 cup for each pancake. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until you see bubbles forming on the surface and the edges look dry.</li>
        <li><strong>Flip and finish:</strong> Flip the pancakes with a spatula and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes, or until the other side is golden brown. Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings!</li>
    </ol>
